<h1>Tic Tac Toe</h1>

This is a complete and awesome <strong>Tic Tac Toe game</strong>, which is one step ahead than any other tic-tac-toe game you ever played, fully optimized for desktop and mobile, with a great design and all the necessary features you could think of (check Features for more details).

<h3>Artificial Intelligence(unbeatable opponent):</h3> To create the AI for this game, I used the Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm, which is an optimization technique for the Mini-Max algorithm. This recursive or backtracking algorithm is used in decision-making and game theory.
